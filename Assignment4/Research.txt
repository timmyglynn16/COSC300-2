A heap is a specific tree based data structure in which all the nodes of tree are in a specific order. 
A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property (min or max ordering).
I used a max binary heap, meaning the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, 
with the maximum-value element at the root. On the other hand, A binomial queue is a collection (or forest) of. 
heap-ordered trees where each tree has a defined structure and capacity and each tree has the familiar heap-order property.
Binomial queues are designed to be merged quickly with one another.

In this case, binary heap is much more efficient when using priority queue operations. Here are some examples why...
1. since binary heap is using array implementation, operations are much more cache friendly
2. binary heap does NOT require extra space for pointers
3. binary heap is much easier to implement than binomial queue (clearly shown in this assignment)
