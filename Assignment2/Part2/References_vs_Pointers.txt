The name 'reference' makes sense for its definition. It is just a reference to an already existing
variable. On the other hand, a pointer holds (or points to) the memory address of a variable.
Both are implemented by storing the address of an object and are both used to have variables accessing
one another. Also, both references and pointers use the same amount of memory. 

While they are similar, references and pointers have their differences. Pointers can be re-assignedd any
number of times while a reference, once binded, cannot be re-assigned. Referenes always have to refer to an
object but pointers can technically point to nothing (null). 

References should be used in function parameters and return types (as shown in my programs). Pointers should be used for implementing 
algorithms (like sorting and searching) and data structres (like arrays).
