# COSC300
programs written in COSC 300

Assignment 1:

Part 1(Coding 80%): Write the following programs using both Java and C++, you are asked to compare between the two implantation from how easy to write perspective, also you need to calculate the execution time for each implementation.
    1- Print the odd numbers from 1 to 1001. Prints 10 numbers per line.
    2- Convert number of days (as a user input) to years, months and days, use input like 85496
    days.
    3- To find the max number of 3 numbers, use input like 45, 76, 26.
    4- Converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and prints out the Celsius
    temperature with two digits to the right of the decimal point. Use 78 as an input.

Part2 (Research Question â€“ 20%): Compare between the following programming languages by the type of applications that might be better implemented using each one of them.
    C++, Java, C, Python and C#
